    These were chants from Wankhade Stadium in an ODI series decider (Ind Vs SA, 2015) where South Africa is belting Indian bowlers to all parts of the grounds. The Mumbai crowd, including the famous North-Stand gang goes berserk chanting ABD despite their local hero Rohit Sharma fielding on the boundary.
    
    Such was the love India had for this extraordinary cricketer.
    
    As a batter there wasn’t anything that AB de Villiers couldn’t do on the cricket field. He has scored 25 runs in 244 balls in the attempt to save a Test (slowest innings of all time for min. 25 runs) as well as the fastest 100 in ODI cricket of just 31 balls. While his abilities were beyond comparison it was when and how he applied himself made him even more special.
    
    In Test matches, he has batted at all positions from 1 to 8, and played more than 15 innings at five different positions, fulfilling whatever role he was asked to. His most prolific runs came at number five where he played the most and scored nearly 4000 runs at an average of 62.11 (best in cricket history). But what is more important that less than half of his aggregate came at that position.
    While a lot of cricketers do everything for their team, ABD is one of the unique few who has done good things for his team by not playing too. The world will always remember ABD as a great cricketer, but one can be quite certain that he would love to be remembered as a great team man.
